# Semantics in pull requests


As I started my professional career as a software developer, I needed to make my first pull request on github. The UI introduced in github at that time was fairly easy to use. 

To make a pull request I just needed to know following things:
* which branch contains my code that I want to add to code base (this is the **source branch**)
* which branch do I want to merge into (this is a **target branch**)
* person that will review my code and underlying technical or business details (**reviewer**)

## The assignee 

Getting to understand these things will let you create your first PR for sure.

But...

When working with a code base that has an **owner** we should also try to assign the **assignee**, it might not be straightforward to understand who that person should be.

I had found a pretty good explanation of who should fit in the **Assignee** role in (this thread on stack overflow)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41087206/on-github-whats-the-difference-between-reviewer-and-assignee]

## Why it sometimes get hard...

To sum up, the **assignee** is the person that **should conduct the merge** of source branch into the target branch. In most cases it will be a developer (possibly you) or some other folk if the code you are merging into has an owner that solidifies all incoming changes. In that case owner will possibly make a review, that will not be so easy to accept, as the owner has wider scope of the source code, rather then fixed only on your feature or fix.

Captains out...
